To utilize these bash scripts, you must first ensure that they are executable.
To do this in linux, you must run chmod +x NameOfScript.sh in terminal.
This allows bash to pick up and interpret the scripts later.
In the different case of the hosts updater scripts, this is written with a CRONJOB in mind.
A cronjob is any task or script that you place in the crontab file to be ran at a certain time.
To not go to deep into it, the basic syntax is this:
*     *     *   *    *        command to be executed
-     -     -   -    -
|     |     |   |    |
|     |     |   |    +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
|     |     |   +------- month (1 - 12)
|     |     +--------- day of        month (1 - 31)
|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)
+------------- min (0 - 59) source: http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference
What I normally do is set the hosts updater to run at 8 every night ex.
00 20 * * * /bin/sh /home/$USER/hostsupdater.sh. 
I set it up under the root account by typing su followed by my password in manjaro,
sudo -i in Ubuntu systems and typing crontab -e.
The maintenance scripts are ok to run manually each month. 
It is recommended that you do not run these without being present.
Hoever, if you wish to run them as cron jobs then you can tweak the cleaning routines as follows.
"sudo rm -r ./cache/*" should be changed to "rm -r /home/$USER/.cache/*" and etc. 
The setup script should only be ran once to set the system up. 
The back up script is ok to use, but the maintenance script already has a backup line to it. 
It is in my opinion pointless to back up more than once or twice a month anyways.
I removed the nvidia installer in the manjaro scripts because manjaro already has a way to install
nvidia automatically, so does Antergos for that matter. 
In Ubuntu/Debian is pretty straight forward, but you have to follow your own distribution's procedure.
Each one is slightly different from another. 
I added a few light weight browser applications in the selective package installer portion of the setup scripts.
Some older hardware can't handle firefox and chromium these days, sadly. 
Though Firefox is still a good browser to use. I also included a time and date setup utility in the setup scripts for
Manjaro and Antergos. 
These use a basic while-loop syntax and basic user prompting to gain input and use that input to set time based on 
the user's choices.
