# Beginner-linux-scripts
These are scripts for beginners to linux, to help setup their systems.
You might have to type sudo chmod +x to make them executable on your system.
When you are ready to use one of these scripts just call it in the terminal or commandline as
./scriptname.sh as for the hosts file updater, right now the simplest way to get it to work is to run it as
sudo ./hostsman4linux.sh and the same goes for the manjaro version. 
The main difference between the two is the use of systemd as an init meaning that it loads everything on your system.
Debian is not included specifically(yet), but many of the ubuntu commands will still work, it's just that some services require the use of /etc/init.d which is like system d and sysvinit which is commonly used, but different. 
Many distros are going towards systemd now, so soon everything will be universal. 
Below is a simple set of instructions should you need them.
