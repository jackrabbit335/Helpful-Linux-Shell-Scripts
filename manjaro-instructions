#It is important to read the disclaimer and this before using these scripts.
#I'll keep this as short and as simple as possible.
#If you want to get the most out of these scripts, there are some features
#That I have personally locked away with a #. 
#You must first remove the # before the commands or features will take #effect. 
#I tried to make these scripts as simple as possible, but no script is #going to set up linux and 
#Make your coffee too. 
#These were a learning experience and as such, they may  or may not work as #expected 
#In every case and instance, but nearly all these commands have been tested
#And they do infact work for me the author. 
#If you experience trouble or serious problems after running these scripts
#You can email me at js185r@gmail.com and tell me I suck or 
#Simply ask a question.
#If you have great success with these scripts, if you don't think I suck
#You can still email me compliments as well. 
#I am not accepting donations as this is a hobby and I donno when
#I'll have time to continue working on these scripts or others in the #future.
#I do ask that you give Quidsup, Matthew Moore, and the others a chance.
#They have really helped me. 
#As for the scripts.
#When running scripts on your system, it is important to remove them from #the folder
#Place the script files into your home directory
#Open a terminal or command line interface and type the following:
#./SCRIPTNAME (You may have to sudo chmod +x SCRIPTNAME first)
#You should type the script names exactly and if all goes well, they should #work.
#You should see lines flow down the screen in the terminal window.
#This is usually normal, unless an error occurs.
#Again, I have tested these scripts on my own machines. 
#They work.
#After fresh installation of manjaro or antergos, it is recommended that
#You only run ./manjarosetup
#After rebooting
#I'd suggest running ./manjaroupdate.sh to just get more familiar with #using scripts
#And to make sure you have all the updates possible. 
#There is a manjarowiki for when you have the time to read it, but
#I'd suggest reading it as soon as possible. 
#I've also included a journald file to replace the one installed. 
#It should be in every way the same except for one small modification I've #made
#Which is to help with keeping your disk space under control.
#I've altered the value and activated the SYSTEMMAXUSE line by placing it #at 50
#And un #ing it in order to limit the journals disk thrashing to 50 #Megabytes.
#If you place all of these files into your home folder after installing #your system, they should run without fail.
#Please make sure you place each of these files into your home folder 
#And alas have fun!
#One more thing, it is also a wise idea to install the systemdreadahead #package from the aur
#You can do so through pamac the little green icon in the system tray at #the bottom right
#It allows you to search the aur if you tell it to in the preferences.
#This package has been known to speed up boot times, but has been #depreciated in some systems.
#It is only a suggestion.
#It's also very important to deal with config files after your updates, any #you might have missed.
#I will try to include a tarball of the etc-update program to help you do #that, just install it
#then run it from the command line with root privilieges 
#I compiled a script to try and attempt a proper installation of the package
#I donno for sure if it will work for you, but it's there just run ./#manjarosetup.sh it should find 
#The script after the updates function. (the setup script now has this #feature).
#If any of these scripts ask for your sudo or root password, give it to #them.
#I also took the liberty of adding a shortcut script that runs etc-update #even after set up
#So you don't have to type the whole line out in the terminal all the time. 
#Try to run all of the scripts as root using
#sudo su then your password before typing ./scriptname.sh
#I've included my own small hosts list to add to the host file.
#I added a line in the hostsman4linux script but I commented it out, you #can take a look at it
#And decide if you want to add it then uncomment that line later on. 
#Here is the wiki: https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
#Another feature I've commented out in the initial set up script is trimming
#Trimming is useful only on SSD's and is not recommended to run all the 
#time as it can also degrade performance as well as improve it.
#You should only run trim at your own risk, it keeps the writes an ssd #makes to a minimum.
#Should you choose to run it, simply remove the # at the start of the two 
#lines sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer and
#sudo systemctl start fstrim.service. 
#Also important to note, if the update doesn't work in manjarosetup.sh 
#It may be a key error which occasionally happens in manjaro unfortunately
#If this happens, run keyerrorresolution.sh script to try and refresh it
#If you want, you can point to this script in the maintenance script
#Just type ./keyerrorresolution.sh somewhere in the script and then save 
#The file again
#What's more, I'd suggest running the hosts file updater as root in crontab
#type sudo crontab -e and hit the corresponding number to the editor
# of your choice and follow the syntax in this notice:
#00 15 * * 3  /bin/bash /home/$USER/hostsman4linux.sh >> hosts.log
#That should run the hosts updater at 3:pm every wednesday, however
#You can use whatever time you wish, just remember it's in military time.
#It should leave a log in your home directory showing you the new hosts file.
#No need to wonder if it ran or not. The output files of the system info section in #maintenance are for troubleshooting hardware problems, they will be in their own #directory within the user's home folder. If you have trouble reading them, you #could try a series of forums, ubuntu, linuxmint, bodhi, manjaro, you can be sure #that someone has read them before on their own systems. If you have questions, or #if something doesn't work, you can even email me again at js185r@gmail.com, #however, I'm no expert, remember I am learning myself. I've also taken the liberty #to add something I wrote on Christmas day, the simple usbimagewriter.sh script #which is fairly simple in design, however, it offers the user an easy and #thoughtless way to create bootable usbs. The default directory is Downloads, so you #might change that to whatever directory you direct most of your iso traffic to. You #can do that in a standard text editor, just right click on the script and click the #text editor option that comes up. Simply change the directory listed after the cd #command in the first line of the script under bin/bash. It's the same as if you #were uncommenting features in the setup scripts only you're changing the directory.
#One more thing about the hosts updater, if you run in crontab with root, 
#Cronie won't look in home folder for all available files, you'll have to put
#cd /home/$USER in the script or move the list file to the root directory. 
#sudo mv list /
